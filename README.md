# KeyWatching
This has no purpose other than I use it for some reactive talks I do. It's a quick and easy way to generate a bunch of observable data. Don't use this for evil.

Look at the KeyWatching.Host console app to see how you can use KeyWatching assembly. You have to set up a message loop and `Application.Run()` is the simplest way to do it.
